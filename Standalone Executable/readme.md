# Installation

In order to run THAMDOF, you will need a MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) **version 9.5 (64-bit version for R2018b)** installed. 

  * If you already have the MCR v9.5, then you can open THAMDOF directly using THAMDOF.exe
  
  * If you do not have the MCR v9.5 installed, you have two options:  
    1. Install both the MCR (from the web) and THAMDOF using FullSetup_web.exe
    2. Navigate to

          http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html

       And download the **64-bit version of the MCR for R2018b** (note that the MCR is a free standalone version of the MATLAB compiler, so you don't need an account for downloading it). For more information about installing and configuring the MCR, visit 

          http://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler/install-the-matlab-runtime.html
       
       Then you can open THAMDOF directly using THAMDOF.exe
