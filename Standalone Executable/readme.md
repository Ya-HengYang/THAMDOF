# Installation

In order to run THAMDOF, you will need a MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) version 9.2 (64-bit version for R2017a) installed. 

  * If you already have the MCR v9.2, then you can open THAMDOF directly using THAMDOF_v3p4.exe
  
  * If you do not have the MCR v9.2 installed, you have two options:  
    1. Install both the MCR (from the web) and THAMDOF using FullSetup_web.exe
    2. Navigate to

          http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html

       And download the 64-bit version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2017a.  
       For more information about installing and configuring the MCR, visit

       Then you can open THAMDOF directly using THAMDOF_v3p4.exe
