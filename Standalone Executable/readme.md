# Installation

In order to run THAMDOF, will need a MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) version 9.2 (64-bit version for R2017a) installed. 

  * If you do not have it installed, you can install both the MCR (from the web) and THAMDOF using FullSetup_web.exe
  * Another option is to navigate to

   http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html

   And download the 64-bit version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2017a.
   For more information about installing and configuring the MCR, visit

  * If you already have the MCR v9.2, then you can open THAMDOF directly using THAMDOF_v3p4.exe
